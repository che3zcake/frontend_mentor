## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Traditional CSS


### What I learned

I have been using frameworks a lot to make my frontend like react and tailwind for style more than I have ever used the traditional CSS, so for me, it was a fun challenge where I used the traditional CSS, learned a lot of things like how to center a div using transform: translate. 
Learned how to get custom font family and text color.


The snippet below is what I learned and implemented to center the div component in the parent div
```css
#main{
  background-color: white;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  padding: 20px 15px 20px 15px;
  width: 300px;
  border-radius: 15px;
}


### Continued development

Even tho I love using tailwind for styling, I will try to use the traditional CSS more for the challenges where ever I can. It is fun but gets confusing as it gets hard to track, maybe It is just my skill issue, but hopefully it will grow on me more (it already has a little bit)

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This has helped me a lot in my css queries like when I don't know the exact syntax for example lets say setting font size. I go to this site and search for it or just google it and that leads me to this site.
- [Centering the div in the parent div/body](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/crafting-the-perfect-website-how-to-center-a-div-in-your-code) - This site showed me multiple ways to center a div in a parent div and here I learned to use the transform: translate method.
